# 🔺 Triangle Perimeter Calculator

This project calculates the perimeter of a triangle based on user input for its three sides.

## 📝 How It Works

The program prompts the user to enter three side lengths and calculates the perimeter using the formula:

```
Perimeter = side1 + side2 + side3
```

## 📌 Example Output

### CLI Version
1. The program asks the user to input the three side lengths.
2. It then calculates and displays the perimeter of the triangle.

#### **Example**
```
Enter the first side: 3
Enter the second side: 4
Enter the third side: 5
The perimeter of the triangle is: 12
```

## 🛠️ Code Breakdown

- Uses `input()` to take user input for the three side lengths.
- Performs a simple arithmetic operation to compute the perimeter.
- Displays the result in a formatted output.

🎉 Enjoy calculating triangle perimeters!
