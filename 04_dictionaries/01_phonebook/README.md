# Phonebook Manager

This project allows users to store, retrieve, and lookup phone numbers using a simple command-line phonebook.

## How It Works

1. The user enters names and phone numbers to store in a dictionary.
2. Pressing Enter without input stops the collection process.
3. The stored phonebook entries are displayed.
4. The user can then lookup a phone number by entering a name.
5. The program notifies if a name is not found.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates user input handling, dictionaries, loops, and basic error handling in Python.
