# Number Frequency Counter

This project allows users to input numbers and then counts how many times each number appears.

## How It Works

1. The user enters numbers one by one.
2. Pressing Enter without input stops the collection process.
3. The program counts how often each number appears.
4. The results are displayed in the terminal.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates user input handling, loops, dictionaries, and error handling in Python.
