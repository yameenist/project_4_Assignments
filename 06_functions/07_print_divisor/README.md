# Divisors Finder

This project is a simple Python program that prints all divisors of a given number.

## How It Works

1. The `print_divisors` function takes an integer and prints all of its divisors.
2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number.
3. The program then calls `print_divisors` to display all the divisors of the given number.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates basic loops and conditional logic in Python.
