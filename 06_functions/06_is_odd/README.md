# Odd or Even Checker

This project is a simple Python program that checks whether numbers in a given range are odd or even.

## How It Works

1. The `is_odd` function checks if a given integer is odd.
2. The `main` function iterates through numbers from 10 to 19, checking if each number is odd or even.
3. The program prints either `{number} odd` or `{number} even` based on the result.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates basic conditional logic and loop iteration in Python.
