# Count Even Numbers in a List

This project is a Python program that counts the number of even numbers in a user-provided list of integers.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter integers one by one.
2. The user can continue entering numbers until they press enter without providing input.
3. The program validates that only integers are accepted.
4. Once input is complete, it calculates and prints the count of even numbers in the list.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates user input handling, list operations, and basic iteration in Python.
