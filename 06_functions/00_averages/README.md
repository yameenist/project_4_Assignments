# Average Calculation Program

This project is a Python program that calculates the average of two numbers.

## How It Works

- The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
- It calls the `average(a, b)` function, which computes the average of the two numbers.
- The result is then displayed to the user.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates function usage, arithmetic operations, and user input handling in Python.
