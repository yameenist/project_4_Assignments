# Countdown Timer

This project performs a countdown from 10 to 1 and prints "Liftoff!" at the end.

## How It Works

1. The program uses a loop to print numbers from 10 down to 1.
2. Once the countdown reaches 1, it prints "Liftoff!" to signal completion.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates basic iteration using a for loop with a decrementing range in Python.
