# Number Guessing Game

This project is a simple Python game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 99.

## How It Works

1. The program generates a random secret number between 1 and 99.
2. The user enters a guess.
3. If the guess is too low or too high, the program provides a hint and prompts the user to guess again.
4. The loop continues until the user guesses the correct number.
5. Once the correct number is guessed, the program congratulates the user.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates basic user input handling, loops, and conditional statements in Python.
