This program repeatedly doubles a user-provided number until it reaches or exceeds 100.

## How It Works

1. The user inputs a number.
2. The program continuously doubles the number and stores the results.
3. The process stops once the value reaches or exceeds 100.
4. The program outputs all doubled values.
