# Even Number Printer

This project prints the first 20 even numbers.

## How It Works

1. The program iterates through a loop 20 times.
2. Each iteration calculates the next even number by multiplying the index by 2.
3. The even number is printed to the console.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates basic iteration and arithmetic operations in Python.
