# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This project generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a predefined maximum value (10,000).

## How It Works

1. The program initializes the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence: 0 and 1.
2. It iterates through the sequence, generating and printing each term.
3. The sequence continues until the next term exceeds 10,000.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates the use of loops, variable swapping, and sequence generation in Python.
