# Affirmation Typing Practice

This project helps users practice typing a positive affirmation correctly.

## How It Works

1. The program displays a predefined affirmation:  
   `"I am capable of doing anything I put my mind to."`
2. The user is prompted to type the affirmation exactly as shown.
3. If the user enters it correctly, they receive a positive message.
4. If the input is incorrect, the program asks them to try again until they get it right.

## Requirements
