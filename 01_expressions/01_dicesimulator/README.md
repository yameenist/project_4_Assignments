# ðŸŽ² Dice Roll Simulator

## Description
This project simulates rolling two dice three times and prints the results.

## Features
- Uses the `random` module to generate random dice rolls.
- Rolls two dice three times and displays the total.
- Demonstrates **variable scope** in Python.

## Installation & Usage

### CLI Version
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Save the script as `app.py`.
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. View the output of three dice rolls.

## Example Output (CLI)
```
Rolling dice...
Roll 1: 3 + 5 = 8
Roll 2: 2 + 6 = 8
Roll 3: 4 + 1 = 5
```

## Notes
- The CLI version runs in the terminal and generates results randomly.
- Great for learning about random number generation and function scope in Python.
