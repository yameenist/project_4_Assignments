# âž— Division Calculator

## Description
This project performs integer division and calculates the remainder.

## Features
- Accepts user input for two numbers: dividend and divisor.
- Computes the quotient and remainder using the formula:
  
  \[ 
  \text{Quotient} = \frac{\text{Dividend}}{\text{Divisor}} \quad \text{(integer division)} 
  \]
  
  \[ 
  \text{Remainder} = \text{Dividend} \mod \text{Divisor} 
  \]
  
- Displays the results instantly.

## Installation & Usage

### CLI Version
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Save the script as `division.py`.
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python division.py
   ```
4. Enter values for the dividend and divisor when prompted.
5. View the calculated quotient and remainder.

## Example Output (CLI)
```
Enter dividend: 5
Enter divisor: 3
Quotient: 1
Remainder: 2
```

## Notes
- This tool is useful for students, programmers, and anyone needing quick division calculations.
