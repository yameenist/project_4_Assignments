# üìê Pythagorean Theorem Calculator

## Description
This project calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

## Features
- Accepts user input for the two shorter sides of a right triangle.
- Computes the hypotenuse using the formula:
  
  \[ c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \]
  
- Displays the result instantly.

## Installation & Usage

### CLI Version
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Save the script as `pythagorean.py`.
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python pythagorean.py
   ```
4. Enter values for the two sides when prompted.
5. View the calculated hypotenuse.

## Example Output (CLI)
```
Enter side A: 3
Enter side B: 4
Hypotenuse: 5.0
```

## Notes
- This tool is useful for students, engineers, and anyone needing quick right triangle calculations.
- Based on the fundamental Pythagorean theorem used in geometry and trigonometry.
