# ⚛️ Mass-Energy Equivalence Calculator

## Description
This project calculates energy using Einstein's famous equation:

\[ E = m \times c^2 \]

## Features
- Asks the user to input mass in kilograms.
- Uses the constant speed of light \( C = 299,792,458 \) m/s.
- Computes energy using Einstein's formula and displays the result.

## Installation & Usage

### CLI Version
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Save the script as `app.py`.
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. Enter mass in kilograms when prompted.
5. View the calculated energy output.

## Example Output (CLI)
```
Enter mass in kg: 2
Energy: 1.798 × 10^17 Joules
```

## Notes
- The CLI version runs in the terminal and computes energy based on user input.
- Great for understanding mass-energy equivalence and the impact of Einstein’s discovery.

Enjoy coding! 🚀
