# Leap Year Checker

## Description
This project determines whether a given year is a leap year based on the Gregorian calendar rules.

## Features
- Accepts user input for a year.
- Checks if the year is a leap year using the following rules:
  - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
  - However, if the year is also divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
- Displays the result accordingly.
