# Height Checker for Rides

## Description
This project determines whether a user is tall enough to ride a rollercoaster based on a pre-specified minimum height.

## Features
- Accepts user input for height.
- Checks if the user meets the minimum height requirement.
- Provides an option for continuous input in the CLI version.

## Installation & Usage

### CLI Version
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Save the script as `app.py`.
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. Enter your height when prompted. Press Enter without input to exit.

## Example Runs (CLI)
```
How tall are you? 100
You're tall enough to ride!
```
```
How tall are you? 30
You're not tall enough to ride, but maybe next year!
```
```
How tall are you?
(Program exits)
```

## Notes
- The CLI version allows multiple height checks until the user exits.
