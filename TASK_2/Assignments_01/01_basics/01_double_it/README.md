# 🔢 Number Doubling Program

This project is a simple Python program that repeatedly doubles a number until it reaches or exceeds 100.

## 📝 How It Works

1. The program prompts the user with:
   ```
   Enter a number:
   ```
2. The user enters a starting number.
3. The program continuously doubles the number and prints each step until it is 100 or greater.

## 📌 Example Output

### CLI Version
#### **User enters 10**
```
Enter a number: 10
20 40 80 160
```

#### **User enters 50**
```
Enter a number: 50
100
```

## 🛠️ Code Breakdown
- Takes user input as an integer.
- Uses a `while` loop to repeatedly double the number until it reaches at least 100.
- Prints each intermediate step on the same line.

🎉 Enjoy experimenting with different starting numbers!
