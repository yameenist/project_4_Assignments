# 🎲 Random Number Generator

This project generates and prints 10 random numbers in the range of 1 to 100.

## 📝 How It Works

1. The program uses Python's `random.randint()` function to generate **10 random numbers**.
2. Each number is between **1 and 100 (inclusive)**.
3. The numbers are printed in a single line, separated by spaces.
4. Every time the program runs, it produces a new set of random numbers.

## 📌 Example Output

```
45 79 61 47 52 10 16 83 19 12

81 76 70 1 27 63 96 100 32 92
```

## 🛠️ Code Breakdown
- Uses the `random.randint(1, 100)` function to generate random numbers.
- Prints the numbers in a single line using a loop.
- Ensures different numbers are generated each time the program runs.

🎉 Great for practicing loops, random number generation, and Python's built-in `random` module!
