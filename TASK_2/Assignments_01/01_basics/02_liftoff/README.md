# 🚀 Countdown Timer

This project is a simple Python countdown timer that counts down from 10 to 1 and prints "Liftoff!" at the end.

## 📝 How It Works

1. The program starts counting down from **10**.
2. It prints each number on the same line.
3. After reaching **1**, it prints **"Liftoff!"**.

## 📌 Example Output

```
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Liftoff!
```

## 🛠️ Code Breakdown
- Uses a `for` loop with `range(10, 0, -1)` to iterate from **10** down to **1**.
- Prints numbers on the same line using `end=" "`.
- Prints **"Liftoff!"** after the loop completes.

🎉 Perfect for beginners learning loops in Python!
