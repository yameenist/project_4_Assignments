# Get Last Element from a List

## Description
This program takes a list of elements from the user and prints the last element. It demonstrates how lists in Python are indexed and how to retrieve the last item efficiently.

## Problem Statement
Given a non-empty list, extract and display the last element. The list length is unknown, but it is guaranteed to have at least one element.

## Features
- Accepts user input to create a list.
- Retrieves and displays the last element.

## Installation & Usage

### CLI Version
1. Ensure Python is installed (Python 3 recommended).
2. Save the script as `app.py`.
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. Enter elements one by one, pressing Enter to stop.
5. The last element will be displayed.

## Example Output (CLI)
```
Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop: apple
Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop: banana
Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop: 
Last Element: banana
```

## Notes
- Uses Python's negative indexing to fetch the last element (`lst[-1]`).
