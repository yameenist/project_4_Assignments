# Get First Element from a List

## Description
This program prompts the user to enter elements into a list and then retrieves the first element from the list. It demonstrates basic list manipulation and user input handling in Python.

## Problem Statement
The program requires users to input a list one element at a time. The function `get_first_element(lst)` prints the first element of the provided list. The list is guaranteed to be non-empty.

## Features
- Accepts user input to create a list.
- Retrieves and displays the first element.

## Installation & Usage

### CLI Version
1. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3 recommended).
2. Save the script as `app.py`.
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. Enter list elements when prompted and press Enter to stop input.

## Example Output (CLI)
```
Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop: Apple
Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop: Banana
Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop:
First Element: Apple
```

## Notes
- Lists in Python maintain order, and indexing starts from 0.
- The program does not handle empty lists explicitly in the CLI version (as the list is guaranteed to be non-empty).
