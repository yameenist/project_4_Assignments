# ðŸ”¢ Number Doubling Application

## Description
This project is designed to take a list of numbers and return a new list where each element is doubled. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of iteration, list manipulation, and user input handling in Python.

## Features
- Accepts a list of numbers as input.
- Iterates through the list and doubles each number.
- Displays the new list with doubled values.

## Installation & Usage

### CLI Version
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Save the script as `app.py`.
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. Enter a list of numbers when prompted, and the program will return their doubled values.

## Example Runs

### CLI Example:
```
Enter numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Doubled numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```
```
Enter numbers: [5, 10, 15]
Doubled numbers: [10, 20, 30]
```

## Notes
- The CLI version runs in the terminal and prompts for user input.
- Error handling is included to detect and handle invalid inputs.
- The script follows a modular approach for better maintainability.

Enjoy coding! ðŸš€
