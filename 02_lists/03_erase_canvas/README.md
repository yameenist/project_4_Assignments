# 🖌️ Canvas Eraser Application

## Description
This project is a simple eraser program that allows users to erase parts of a grid-based canvas. The canvas consists of blue cells (`🟦`), and the eraser turns them white (`⬜`).

## Features

- Eraser moves using keyboard inputs (`⬅️ ⬆️ ⬇️ ➡️`).
- Cells turn white when erased.
- Simple and interactive console-based interface.

## Installation & Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3 recommended).
2. Save the script as `app.py`.
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. Use arrow keys to move the eraser around the grid.
