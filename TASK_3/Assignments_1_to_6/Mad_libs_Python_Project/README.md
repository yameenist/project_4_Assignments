# 📝 Mad Libs Story Generator

This project generates a fun and creative story based on user-provided words.

## 📝 How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a **noun**, an **adjective**, and a **verb**.
2. It validates the input to ensure only single words are entered without spaces or commas.
3. The provided words are inserted into a predefined sentence structure to create a short story.
4. The generated story is then displayed on the screen.

## 📌 Example Output
