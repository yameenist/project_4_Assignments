# 📊 Simple Data Dashboard

This project is a simple data dashboard built using Streamlit. It allows users to upload a CSV file, preview the data, filter it based on specific columns, and visualize selected data using a line chart.

## 🕹️ How It Works

1. The user uploads a CSV file.
2. The program reads the data and displays:
   - A preview of the first few rows.
   - A summary of the dataset (descriptive statistics).
3. The user selects a column to filter the data and picks a value to display only matching rows.
4. The user selects columns for the x-axis and y-axis to generate a line chart of the filtered data.
5. The user can upload a new file and repeat the process.
