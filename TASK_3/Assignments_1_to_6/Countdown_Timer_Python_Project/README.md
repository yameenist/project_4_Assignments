# ⏳ Countdown Timer

This project is a simple countdown timer that allows users to enter a duration in seconds and watch the countdown run in real-time.

## 🕹️ How It Works

1. The user enters the number of seconds for the countdown.
2. The timer starts and updates every second, displaying the remaining time in `MM:SS` format.
3. Once the countdown reaches zero, a message "⏰ Time's up!" is displayed.
4. The user is given the option to start another countdown or exit the program.

## 📌 Example Output

```
⏳ Countdown Timer
==================
Enter the countdown time in seconds: 10

Starting countdown...
00:10
00:09
00:08
...
00:01
⏰ Time's up!

Do you want to start another timer? (yes/no): no
Thanks for using the Countdown Timer! Goodbye! ⏳
```

## 🛠️ Code Breakdown

- **User Input Handling:** Ensures the user enters a valid positive number.
- **Countdown Mechanism:** Uses a loop and `time.sleep(1)` to decrement the timer each second.
- **Formatted Output:** Displays the remaining time in a clean `MM:SS` format.
- **Replay Option:** Allows users to restart the countdown if desired.

🎉 A great project to practice loops, user input handling, and time functions in Python!
