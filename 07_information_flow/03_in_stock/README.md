# Fruit Stock Checker

This project is a Python program that checks the stock availability of a specific fruit in Sophia's inventory.

## How It Works

- The program prompts the user to enter the name of a fruit.
- It calls the `num_in_stock(fruit)` function, which checks the inventory for the specified fruit.
- If the fruit is in stock, the program displays the quantity available.
- If the fruit is not in stock, it informs the user accordingly.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates dictionary usage, user input handling, and conditional statements in Python.
