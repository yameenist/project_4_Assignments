# Adult Age Checker

This project is a simple Python program that determines whether a person is legally an adult in the U.S. based on their age.

## How It Works

- The program defines `ADULT_AGE` as 18.
- It uses the `is_adult(age)` function to check if the given age is 18 or older.
- The `main()` function prompts the user to enter their age and prints `True` if they are an adult or `False` otherwise.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates basic conditional statements and user input handling in Python.
