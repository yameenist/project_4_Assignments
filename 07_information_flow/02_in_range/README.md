# Number Range Checker

This project is a Python program that checks whether a given number is within a specified range.

## How It Works

- The program prompts the user to enter a number.
- It then asks for a lower and upper bound.
- The `in_range(n, low, high)` function checks if the number is within the given range (inclusive).
- The result (`True` or `False`) is displayed to the user.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates basic conditional statements and user input handling in Python.
